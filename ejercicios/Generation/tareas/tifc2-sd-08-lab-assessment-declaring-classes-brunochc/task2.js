2. You have now been asked to improve your code, so that the player objects can define both a name and a level number.
    * Modify the Player class so that it will accept a Player "name" string and a "**level**" number in two separate arguments.
        * The key of this property in the resulting object **must** be "`level`" - remember, **computers are very literal**!
