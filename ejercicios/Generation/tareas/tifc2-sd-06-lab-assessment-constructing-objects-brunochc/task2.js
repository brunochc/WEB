/*
2. You have been presented with a constructor for a Mail object.
    * Modify the code so that the user provides their own subject and message as a execution parameters in that order.
    * Execution parameters are the values that are passed to a program when it is run.
    * For example, if the user runs the program with the command `node index.js 2 hello world`, then "node" is the program, "index.js" is the first parameter, "2" is the second parameter, and "hello" and "world" are the third and fourth parameters respectively.
    * You can access the execution parameters in your program by using the `process.argv` array.
    * In the example, the process and the first parameter (index 0 and 1 of the `process.argv` array) are "node" and "index.js", so you can ignore them.
    * The second parameter (index 2) is used by this program to determine the task number to execute, so you can ignore it as well.
    * You can access the subject and message by using `process.argv[3]` and `process.argv[4]` respectively.
