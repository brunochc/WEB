/*
4. You have now been asked to include a method for levelling a player up, increasing their level number by one.
    * Modify the Player class so that it will accept a Player name string and a level number in two separate arguments.
    * Then, define a shared object method `info()` that will output the following string:
        * `<name> has reached Level <level>`!
    * Finally, define a second shared object method named `levelUp()` that will **increment** the level of the Player.
*/

  info() {
    console.log(`${this.name} has reached Level ${this.level}!`);
